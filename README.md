# Dinoplasty

to do:
*reload dinos + add to page (will use reverse func on array)
*make sure ids dont repeat when reload page
*up and down buttons work
*add another field to form, make sure goes into array too
  *ex: food, era, etc
*make "span's content editable" (able to change dinos already in list)
