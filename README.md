# Dinoplasty

to do:
*reload dinos + add to page (will use reverse func on array) - almost
*make sure ids dont repeat when reload page - done
*up and down buttons work - almost
*add another field to form, make sure goes into array too - done
  *ex: food, era, etc
*make "span's content editable" (able to change dinos already in list) - not yet
